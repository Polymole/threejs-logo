## ThreeJS icon proposal

When we created our site, http://polymole.it, we needed a logo for the technology and tools we use in our projects. 

We use ThreeJS, as thousands of developers in the world, a we would like to have a compact icon for ThreeJS in the technology slider, so we created it.

Here's the ThreeJS logo and icon in different flavours: PNG, JPEG and SVG.
